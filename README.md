# Nutricities
Type in a city, press the right arrow, and you will see the average health
rating of the city based on its restaurants. It will also show the worst
and the best restaurants in the city.

This website was created at HackBU (Binghamton University's yearly
24 hour hackathon) on February 10 - 11 2018 by:

Mark Nash - BS Computer Science - Rochester Institute of Technology
Graduation date: 2020
and
Daniel Boaitey - BS Computer Science - Rochester Institute of Tchnology
Graduation date: 2021

## Languages and Tools
This project used Javascript, HTML, CSS, and PHP
PHP handeled the api calls and passed the data to the javascript code.

While testing this website on Localhost, we used XAMPP

## APIs
We used the Google Maps API free trial to help show the user suggestions
based on the string they entered so far in the city text box. That also
gave us input validation that a city is actually a city.

We used the Zomato API free trial to get seemingly endless amounts of
information about restaurants in a specific city. We used the type of
restaurant to rank a sampling of 30 random restaurants from the city.
In the future we will implement a better ranking system for health.
