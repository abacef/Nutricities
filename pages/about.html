  <p>NutriCities is focused on bringing the world closer to a healthier version of itself. Our mission today starts with
  providing reccomendations on restaurants in cities around the world based on our 1 - 7 NutriCities rating system.
  Those 7 points allow you, as a consumer and citizen of this Earth, to have the ability to be aware of the health or lack
   of health with food you might be eating everyday. Join us as we embark on this journey towards a healthier humanity</p>
